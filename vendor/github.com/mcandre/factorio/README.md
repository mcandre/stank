# ABOUT

factorio accelerates Go application development, by automating the process of generating binaries for a multitude of platforms. Your time is valuable. Spend it developing software, not tinkering with toolchains.

factorio is fast. It has no intrinsic dependency on any containers or virtual machines. Factorio plugs directly into the standard `go` command line system.

# CONFIGURATION

The default subdirectory can be customized with a `FACTORIO_BANNER` environment variable, e.g. `FACTORIO_BANNER=hello-0.0.1`. Then artifacts will appear in `bin/hello-0.0.1/`. This is helpful when structuring file paths in prepraration for compressed archives, for example.

factorio primarily assists conventional PC (desktop/laptop/workstation/server) applications. factorio enables the standard platforms expected to work out of the box for `go build`, particularly any pure Go project.

factorio will exclude mobile platforms by default. You can customize the platform blocklist by supplying a Go [Regexp](https://godoc.org/regexp) to a `FACTORIO_PLATFORM_BLOCKLIST` environment variable, e.g. `FACTORIO_PLATFORM_BLOCKLIST=//`.

factorio is essentially compatible with `go build` flags and environment variables. Any Extra environment variables or flags you pass to `factorio` will propagate to `go build`.
